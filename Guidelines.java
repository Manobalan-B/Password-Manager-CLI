        System.out.println("\n   Make sure your password has between 12 and 16 characters. In general, longer passwords offer greater security.");
        System.out.println("\n--> Make use of combinations of capital, lowercase, numerals, and special characters (!, @, #, $, %) in your password. This makes your password stronger and more complex.");
        System.out.println("\n--> Avoid using terms that are simple to figure out, including \"password,\" \"123456,\" your name, your birthdate, or well-known expressions. Automated programs are used by hackers to quickly crack simple passwords.");
        System.out.println("\n--> For every account, use a separate password. If one of your passwords is compromised, you become more vulnerable if you reuse it for other accounts.");
        System.out.println("\n--> Instead of using just one word, think about employing a passphrase. A passphrase is a string of characters or a sentence that is simple to recall for you but challenging for others to decipher.");
        System.out.println("\n--> Using internet tools like password managers, create random passwords. Passwords generated at random are more difficult to crack than passwords made by hand.");
        System.out.println("\n--> Refrain from utilizing dictionary terms in their entirety. To break passwords, hackers employ dictionary assaults, which attempt to use every word in the dictionary.");
        System.out.println("\n--> Add misspellings or character replacements to your password. For instance, swap out letters for numbers or symbols that have a similar appearance (for example, \"$\" for \"S\" and \"0\" for \"O\").");
        System.out.println("\n--> Frequently change your passwords, especially for critical accounts like email or bank accounts.");
